# Reclassify GOA hauls

# The Gulf of Alaska survey is adopting a stratified random design in 2025. Strata align with NMFS 
# statistical area boundaries in the new design. Previously, stratum boundaries aligned with INPFC
# strata. In order to produce ESR indicator time series that align with ne subarea/stratum 
# boundaries, historical hauls need to be assigned to new strata. This analysis compares two 
# approaches to reassigning hauls to new strata.


# Option 1: Join historical hauls with new strata and calculate indices ----


# Option 2: Post-stratify hauls and assign to new strata (Z. Oyafuso recommended approach) ----



# Compare regional time series ----

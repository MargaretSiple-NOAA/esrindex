	<statusAndTrends>Echinoderms are frequently captured in all areas of the AI survey, occurring in 80–90% of all bottom trawl hauls. Echinoderm mean CPUE is typically higher in the central and eastern AI than in other areas, although frequency of occurrence in trawl catches is consistently high across all areas. Echinoderm CPUE has been stable in the western and eastern Aleutians since 2018 and declined in the central Aleutians and southern Bering Sea in 2022. Eelpout CPUEs have been stable and low in the western Aleutians and southern Bering Sea, but declined in 2022 in the central and eastern Aleutians. Eelpouts generally occur in <10% of survey hauls across all areas. Poachers occur in a relatively large number of tows across the AI survey area (about 30–40% consistently), but mean CPUE trends are unclear and abundance appears low. A shrimp time series has been calculated since 2016 that shows a variable pattern of abundance through time. Shrimp CPUE in 2022 was lower in the western AI, low and similar to abundance in 2018 in the central and eastern Aleutians, and appeared to increase in the southern Bering Sea.</statusAndTrends>

	<implications>AI survey results provide limited information about abundance or abundance trends for these species due to problems in catchability. Therefore, the indices presented are likely of limited value to fisheries management. These species are not typically commercially important, but the trends in shrimp especially should be monitored as these are an important prey base for benthic commercial species.</implications>

		<figureCaption>Mean biomass index of Miscellaneous Species (eelpouts, poachers, sea stars, shrimps) from AFSC/RACE summer bottom trawl surveys of the Aleutian Islands from 1991 to 2024. Panels show the observed total survey biomass (blue points), standard error (vertical error bars), biomass index time series mean (solid black line), 95% confidence interval (gray shading), overall time series mean (solid gray line), and horizontal lines representing one and two standard deviations from the mean, respectively.</figureCaption>

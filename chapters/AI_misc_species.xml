Methods for producing this indicator have been updated this year to account for process error in survey abundance estimates, facilitate interpretation of indicator trends, utilize consistent statistical methods across ESR regions, and ensure consistent species group composition across regions. Previously, two time series were presented for each species group: (1) average bottom trawl survey catch-per-unit effort for within INPFC subareas (CPUE, kg ha) that were scaled proportionally to the maximum CPUE in the bottom trawl survey time series, and (2) frequency of occurrence of each species group among bottom trawl survey hauls within INPFC subareas.

This year, subarea biomass estimates were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex], which uses the Wakabayashi et al. (1985) method to estimate design-based abundance index means and coefficients of variation (CVs) from catch (kg) and effort data (area swept; ha) collected during Aleutian Islands summer bottom trawl surveys. Then, abundance index time series means and confidence intervals were estimated by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to INPFC subarea biomass estimates and CVs using the R package _rema_ [@rema; @Sullivan2022] to account for process error in indicator time series. The code and methods to calculate abundance indices and fit REM to time series are implemented in the R package _esrindex_ [@esrindex].

	<statusAndTrends>Echinoderms are frequently captured in all areas of the AI survey, occurring in 80–90% of all bottom trawl hauls. Echinoderm mean CPUE is typically higher in the central and eastern AI than in other areas, although frequency of occurrence in trawl catches is consistently high across all areas. Echinoderm CPUE has been stable in the western and eastern Aleutians since 2018 and declined in the central Aleutians and southern Bering Sea in 2022. Eelpout CPUEs have been stable and low in the western Aleutians and southern Bering Sea, but declined in 2022 in the central and eastern Aleutians. Eelpouts generally occur in <10% of survey hauls across all areas. Poachers occur in a relatively large number of tows across the AI survey area (about 30–40% consistently), but mean CPUE trends are unclear and abundance appears low. A shrimp time series has been calculated since 2016 that shows a variable pattern of abundance through time. Shrimp CPUE in 2022 was lower in the western AI, low and similar to abundance in 2018 in the central and eastern Aleutians, and appeared to increase in the southern Bering Sea.</statusAndTrends>

	<implications>AI survey results provide limited information about abundance or abundance trends for these species due to problems in catchability. Therefore, the indices presented are likely of limited value to fisheries management. These species are not typically commercially important, but the trends in shrimp especially should be monitored as these are an important prey base for benthic commercial species.</implications>

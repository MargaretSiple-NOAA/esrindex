	<indicatorDescription>'Miscellaneous' species fall into three groups: eelpouts (fishes of the Family Zoarcidae), poachers (fishes of the Family Agonidae), and sea stars (Class Asteroidea). The three species comprising the bulk of the eelpout group are the wattled eelpout (_Lycodes palearis_) and shortfn eelpout (_L. brevipes_) and to a lesser extent the marbled eelpout (_L. raridens_). The biomass of poachers is dominated by the sturgeon poacher (_Podothecus acipenserinus_) and to a lesser extent the sawback poacher (_Leptagonus frenatus_). The composition of sea stars is dominated by the purple-orange sea star (_Asterias amurensis_), found primarily in the inner/middle shelf, and the common mud star (_Ctenodiscus crispatus_), primarily in the outer shelf.
	
Regional and stratum indices of abundance time series (biomass; kt) and confidence intervals were estimated for each taxonomic group by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to stratum-level design-based indices of abundance calculated from AFSC summer bottom trawl survey catch and effort data. Indices were calculated for the entire standardized survey time series (1982 to 2024 in the eastern Bering Sea and 2010 to 2023 in the northern Bering Sea). Design-based indices of abundance were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex] and REM were fitted to survey time series using the _rema_ R package [@rema]. Code and methods to calculate these indicators are provided in the _esrindex_ R package and repository [@esrindex].

Methods for producing this indicator have been updated this year to account for process error in survey abundance estimates, facilitate interpretation of indicator trends, utilize consistent statistical methods across ESR regions, and ensure consistent species group composition across regions. Previously, time series for this indicator were calculated as the average bottom trawl survey catch-per-unit effort for the full survey area (CPUE, kg ha) that were scaled proportionally to the maximum CPUE in the bottom trawl survey time series.

This year, stratum biomass estimates were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex], which uses the Wakabayashi et al. (1985) method to estimate design-based abundance index means and coefficients of variation (CVs) from catch (kg) and effort data (area swept; ha) collected during EBS and NBS summer bottom trawl surveys. Then, abundance index time series means and confidence intervals were estimated by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to stratum biomass estimates and CVs using the R package _rema_ [@rema; @Sullivan2022] to account for process error in indicator time series. The code and methods to calculate abundance indices and fit REM to time series are implemented in the R package _esrindex_ [@esrindex].

In this update, we also provide figures showing REM estimates of abundance, by stratum, to improve the characterization of spatial abundance patterns and trends, similar to subarea trends that have been presented in the AI and GOA ESRs.

	_Eastern Bering Sea:_ 

	The 2023 relative CPUE estimate for eelpouts showed a modest increase from 2022, just above the average of the estimates over the last 10 years. For poachers, CPUE decreased from 2022, returning to levels seen in 2017, ending a multi-year upward trend (2018–2021). The 2023 poacher estimate is just below the average for the time series. The CPUE for sea stars in 2023 also broke a multi-year upward trend (2017–2021), with the 2023 estimate returning to a level last seen in 2016 (Figure 95). 

	_Northern Bering Sea:_ 

	The relative CPUE estimates for eelpouts are much higher before 2018 than after. Whether this indicates a trend is unclear given the gaps in sampling years. For poachers, the CPUE was likewise low after 2018, but it was also low in 2010, with 2017 being an outlier of high relative CPUE. The CPUE for sea stars is remarkably consistent across the time series, especially compared with all other groups in this report (Figure 96).
	</statusAndTrends>
	<factorsInfluencingTrends>It is difficult to identify trends, especially for the NBS given that survey has been conducted intermittently and only recently (i.e., starting in 2017) been conducted on a more regular schedule. Determining whether, for example, the low relative CPUE after 2018 in poachers (EBS and NBS) and eelpouts (NBS) represents real responses to environmental change or is an artifact of standardized survey sampling methodology (e.g., temperature dependent catchability) will require more specifc research on survey trawl gear selectivity relative to interannual diferences in bottom temperatures and on the life history characteristics of these epibenthic species.</factorsInfluencingTrends>
	<implications>Eelpouts have important roles in the energy fow within benthic communities. For example, eelpouts are a common prey item of arrowtooth flounder (_Atheresthes stomias_). However, it is not known at present whether these changes in CPUE are related to changes in energy fow.</implications>

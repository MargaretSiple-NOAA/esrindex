	<indicatorDescription> Forage fish are key prey for a variety of groundfish, as well as seabirds and marine mammals. Individual species of forage fish respond differently to environmental conditions. This indicator consists of data from several forage groups.

	The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division’s Groundfish Assessment Program (RACE-GAP) fishery-independent summer bottom trawl surveys in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) are designed to assess populations of commercially and ecologically important fishes and invertebrates. Since 1990, we have deployed the same standardized trawl gear (footrope and trawl net) as is presently in use in the GOA bottom trawl survey (Siple et al. 2023). The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has identified several forage fish species or groups of species for federal management. The survey catches Pacific sandlance, eulachon, capelin, sandfish, and pricklebacks though the trawl mesh size is sufficiently large to allow escapement for most of these species. Because of the highly variable design-based biomass estimates from the trawl survey, the biomass of each forage fish was log-transformed to better show trends. For each species or species group, the largest log-transformed biomass estimate over the time series was arbitrarily scaled to a value of 100 and all other values were scaled in reference to that. The standard error (± 1) was weighted proportionally to the biomass to get a relative standard error.</indicatorDescription>
	<methodologicalChanges>
	In 2025, a redesigned bottom trawl survey was implemented in the GOA, including a redefinition of strata based on NMFS management areas instead of INPFC areas. For the indices presented here, hauls from all years were post-stratified to the new survey strata to calculate indicator values for the full time series.

	Methods for producing this indicator have been updated this year to account for process error in survey abundance estimates, facilitate interpretation of indicator trends, utilize consistent statistical methods across ESR regions, and ensure consistent species group composition across regions. Previously, two time series were presented for each species group: (1) average bottom trawl survey catch-per-unit effort for within NMFS subareas (CPUE, kg ha) that were scaled proportionally to the maximum CPUE in the bottom trawl survey time series, and (2) frequency of occurrence of each species group among bottom trawl survey hauls within NMFS subareas.

This year, we estimated the index of abundance time series by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to INPFC subarea biomass estimates and CVs using the R package _rema_ [@rema; @Sullivan2022] to account for process error in indicator time series. Subarea biomass estimates were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex], which uses the @Wakabayashi1985 method to estimate design-based indices of abundance from catch (kg) and effort data (area swept; ha) collected during Aleutian Islands summer bottom trawl surveys. The code and methods to calculate abundance indices and fit REM to time series are implemented in the R package _esrindex_ [@esrindex].

	</methodologicalChanges>
	<statusAndTrends>Forage fish sampled by the bottom trawl survey in 2023 were above 1SD for herring and capelin, and below 1SD for myctophids. The largest changes since the last survey in 2021, include an increase in herring and a decrease in myctophids by about 1SD.
	[add highlights about 2025 relative to previous years]
	  Eulachon have been most prevalent in the Yakutat survey district though their greatest biomass has historically occurred in the Kodiak district where biomass appears to be increasing in recent surveys after highs recorded between 2000 and 2015 (Figure 57). Capelin biomass has historically been highest in the Kodiak district. Sandfish, prickelbacks, and sand lance are uniformly uncommon in trawl catches across the GOA survey years and districts, though there are episodic years with large biomass estimates for these species over the survey history.
	  The biomass of forage fishes in the GOA is difficult to measure in NOAA Fisheries’ bottom trawl survey catches due to issues such as gear selectivity and catchability. Therefore, we anticipate that the relative biomass estimates presented here for forage fishes are imprecise so that apparent trends should be interpreted cautiously. </statusAndTrends>
	<factorsInfluencingTrends>, In the GOA herring and sand lance have been observed to positively respond to warm environmental conditions, while capelin increase during cooler periods (CITATIONS). [ADD MORE] </factorsInfluencingTrends>
	<implications>The NOAA Fisheries’ survey trawl gear has catchability and selectivity issues for forage fishes that impact their catch and retention. However, as catchability and selectivity have not changed over time, trends in the biomass of these species estimated from trawl survey samples can be considered a useful indicator. Recent increases in herring biomass may indicate more availability of forage for humpback whales and other known herring predators. [ADD MORE]  </implications>

Groups considered to be structural epifauna include: sea pens, corals, anemones, and sponges. Corals are rarely encountered in the eastern Bering Sea so they were not included here. For each group, biomass indices were updated for 2024 from the eastern Bering Sea shelf survey.

Since 1982, the RACE Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) and Shellfish Assessment Program (SAP) have conducted annual fishery-independent summer bottom trawl surveys on the EBS shelf using standardized trawl gear and methods. Biomass index trends from the survey are likely to reflect changes in the abundance of species and life history stages that are available to the survey, especially if trends are sustained over time.

Regional and stratum indices of abundance (biomass in kilotons) and confidence intervals were estimated for each taxonomic group by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to stratum-level design-based abundance index time series calculated from AFSC summer bottom trawl survey catch and effort data. Indices were calculated for the standardized survey time series (EBS: 1982 to 2025, NBS: 2010 to 2025). Design-based indices of abundance were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex] and REM were fitted to survey time series using the _rema_ R package [@rema]. Code and data used to produce these indicators are provided in the _esrindex_ R package and repository [@esrindex].

	_Eastern Bering Sea:_ 

Sponges have undergone cyclical variability in abundance throughout the time series (Figure STEP1). The biomass of sponges (Porifera) in 2024 remains >1 standard deviation below the time series average, which is a continuation of  the extremely low biomass level observed since 2021. Similarly low biomass was also observed intermittently early in the time series, 1984–1992. Sponges have primarily been observed in Stratum 30, the southern middle shelf, at 50–100 m bottom depth (Figure STEP2).

The biomass of sea anemones (Actiniaria) has been above average from  2022-2024, similar to 2010–2015. The recent period of above-average biomass contrasts with the period of near-average biomass observed from 2016–2021. Sea anemones are regularly encountered in all EBS survey strata, except Stratum 20, the inner shelf (< 50 m) north-northwest of Kuskokwim Bay, near Nunivak Island.
Sea pen (Pennatulacea) biomass has increased since 2019 and has remained above the time series average since 2019. Sea pens are most abundant on the outer shelf (100-200 m bottom depth) in Strata 50 and 60. 


	_Northern Bering Sea:_

	<factorsInfluencingTrends>Further research in several areas would facilitate the interpretation of structural epifauna trends including systematics and taxonomy of Bering Sea shelf invertebrates, better characterization of survey gear efficiency, and the life history characteristics of the epibenthic organisms captured by the survey trawl.</factorsInfluencingTrends>

	<implications>Structural epifauna are utilized as habitat by commercial groundfish species in Alaska [@Rooper2019], although associations on the Bering Sea shelf are not well understood. Sponges can be extremely long-lived and have slow recovery times from disturbance, meaning they may be vulnerable to impacts from fishing gear [@Montero-Serra2018; @Malecha2017]. However, very little is known about the longevity and growth rates of most sponge taxa in Alaska. Generally, sponge longevity increases with depth [@Stone2019]. Understanding the trends as well as the distribution patterns of structural epifauna is important for modeling habitat to develop spatial management plans for protecting habitat, understanding fishing gear impacts, and predicting responses to future climate change [@Rooper2016]. More research on the eastern Bering Sea shelf will be needed to determine if there are definitive links.</implications>
	<researchPriorities>The bottom trawl survey uses standardized survey protocols aimed at ensuring consistent sampling efficiency. However, additional research is needed to better characterize the catchability and selectivity of structural epifauna groups by the bottom trawl survey.</researchPriorities>

	<indicatorDescription>The time series for jellyfishes (Scyphozoa, but primarily _Chrysaora melanaster_) relative CPUE by weight (kg per hectare) was updated for 2023 from both the eastern (Figure 61, top) and northern (Figure 61, bottom) Bering Sea surveys. Catch methods for the Northern Bering Sea (NBS) were standardized in 2010, so the catches from previous years do not provide comparable data and are consequently excluded. 
	
Regional and stratum index of abundance time series (biomass; kt) and confidence intervals were estimated for jellyfish by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to a stratum-level design-based index of abundance calculated from AFSC summer bottom trawl survey catch and effort data. The index was calculated for the entire standardized survey time series (1982 to 2024 in the eastern Bering Sea and 2010 to 2023 in the northern Bering Sea). The design-based index of abundance were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex] and REM were fitted to survey time series using the _rema_ R package [@rema]. Code and methods to calculate these indicators are provided in the _esrindex_ R package and repository [@esrindex].

	<methodologicalChanges>
Methods for producing this indicator have been updated this year to account for process error in survey abundance estimates, facilitate interpretation of indicator trends, utilize consistent statistical methods across ESR regions, and ensure consistent species group composition across regions. Previously, time series for this indicator were calculated as the average bottom trawl survey catch-per-unit effort for the full survey area (CPUE, kg ha) that were scaled proportionally to the maximum CPUE in the bottom trawl survey time series.

This year, stratum biomass estimates were calculated using the _gapindex_ R package [@gapindex], which uses the Wakabayashi et al. (1985) method to estimate design-based abundance index means and coefficients of variation (CVs) from catch (kg) and effort data (area swept; ha) collected during EBS and NBS summer bottom trawl surveys. Then, abundance index time series means and confidence intervals were estimated by fitting a multivariate random effects model (REM) to stratum biomass estimates and CVs using the R package _rema_ [@rema; @Sullivan2022] to account for process error in indicator time series. The code and methods to calculate abundance indices and fit REM to time series are implemented in the R package _esrindex_ [@esrindex].

In this update, we also provide figures showing REM estimates of abundance, by stratum, to improve the characterization of spatial abundance patterns and trends, similar to subarea trends that have been presented in the AI and GOA ESRs.

	_Eastern Bering Sea:_

	The relative CPUE for jellyfishes in the eastern Bering Sea in 2023 is virtually unchanged from the 2022 survey estimate, similar to the catch rates observed 1992–1999 and in 2018. There is an apparent pattern of cyclical rise and fall of CPUE values across the time series. The relatively low biomass estimated throughout the 1980’s was followed by a period of increasing biomass of jellyfishes throughout the 1990s (Brodeur et al., 1999). A second period of relatively low CPUE estimates from 2001 to 2008 was then followed by a second period with relatively higher CPUE values from 2009 to 2015. It is worth noting that, prior to this year, jellyfish CPUE estimates in the EBS have been relatively inconsistent over the past several survey years. 

	_Northern Bering Sea:_

	The relative CPUE for jellyfishes in the northern Bering Sea is inconsistent across the time series. While an apparent pattern of cyclical rise and fall of jellyfish CPUE values exists in the EBS time series, gaps in sampling years across the northern Bering Sea time series makes identifying multi-year trends difcult.</statusAndTrends>

	<factorsInfluencingTrends>The fluctuations in jellyfish biomass and their impacts on forage fish, juvenile walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), and salmon in relation to other biophysical indices were investigated by Cieciel et al. (2009) and Brodeur et al. (2002, 2008). Ice cover, sea-surface temperatures in the spring and summer, and wind mixing all infuence jellyfish biomass, and afect jellyfish sensitivity to prey availability (Brodeur et al., 2008).</factorsInfluencingTrends>
	<implications>Jellyfish are pelagic consumers of zooplankton, larval and juvenile fishes, and small forage fishes. A large infux of pelagic consumers such as jellyfish can decrease zooplankton and small fish abundance, which in turn can afect higher trophic levels causing changes to the community structure of the ecosystem.</implications>
